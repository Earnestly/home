# XDG_DATA_HOME/borg/filter

# For use with borg and the following command-line:
# borg -p create -C zstd -s --filter 'AMEdbchsfi-?' --list --patterns-from "$HOME"/.local/share/borg/filter user@remote:/backup/location::archive .

# NOTES
#   The default notation is sh: which mimics typical shell style globbing.  The
#   exception is **, which is recursive, much like globstar found in bash.
#
#   ! instructs borg to completely ignore the file or directory as opposed to -
#   which will still result in traversal in the case of a sub-directory being
#   later included. Using ! is therefore a fairly dramatic performance boost
#   especially if the directories which would otherwise be traversed are deep
#   and large.
#
#   The more broad the inclusion the later it needs to be listed.  If a broad
#   inclusion is first then everything will be included and any subsequent
#   negations are ignored as the first takes precedence.  As a result the
#   specific inclusions and exclusions should be listed in order of narrowest
#   scope to greatest.
#
#   The use of relative paths in this list requires the borg create command to
#   also use a relative path such as . when in the directory /home/earnest.
#   It appears that attempts to set the root prefix with 'R' are all
#   unsuccessful even if the path is absolute or not.

# The use of this construct is to guard the case of borg create being used
# without specifying a relative path.  If /home appears in the given path (such
# as /home/earnest) then this pattern prevents any potential files being
# matched found below it.
