INTRODUCTION

  These configurations depend heavily on the XDG Base Directory
  Specification, custom environments, and command-line options to relocate
  the default directories and files into a more reasonable structure.

  See <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support>
  
GENERAL LAYOUT

  The structure I've chosen is mostly to mimic the /usr/local convention
  and the FHS. There are small changes to the naming and meaning of the
  directories based on Plan 9 but most should be fairly understandable.

    HOME/local (LOCALDIR)
    |- bin
    |- cfg
    |- data
    |- lib
    `- var
       |- cache
       `- log

  Note that the data directory is similar to share but deliberately more
  general. Data normally in share would appear here along with other
  architecture independent library-like files or persistent state.

ENVIRONMENTS

  LOCALDIR=$HOME/local
  XDG_DATA_HOME=$LOCALDIR/data
  XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$LOCALDIR/cfg
  XDG_CACHE_HOME=$LOCALDIR/var/cache

ASSUMPTIONS
  
  These configurations need to make a few unfortunate assumptions about
  the environment, I'll attempt to list the known ones here.
  
  - The shell is zsh built with --enable-etcdir=/etc/zsh.

    The ZDOTDIR environment configured as HOME/local/cfg/zsh in
    /etc/zsh/zshenv as the LOCALDIR environment is not available at
    this point.
  
  - The Xorg server is started with a custom sx script.

  - The system-config package is installed.

    <https://github.com/Earnestly/pkgbuilds/tree/master/system-config>
  
  - HOME/local is a directory and the environment LOCALDIR refers to it.
  
  - XDG_CONFIG_HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME and XDG_DATA_HOME environments are
    correctly configured as defined in ENVIRONMENTS.
  
ISSUES

  - zsh

    Zsh is able to relocate its various configurations via ZDOTDIR,
    however the files are all still prefixed with a dot.

    <http://www.zsh.org/mla/workers/2013/msg00702.html>

      > We might need to think about rules for finding e.g. ~/.zsh/zshrc
      > instead of ~/.zsh/.zshrc since the extra dot is pretty unhelpful.
      > (E.g. look for the file without the dot if a parent directory does
      > have a dot at the start. We don't want to look for ~/zshrc, that
      > could easily be problematic.)

  - vimperator

    Requires code in the VIMPERATOR_INIT environment.

  - llpp

    Stores history in the configuration file making it difficult to
    share nicely across multiple machines.

  - systemd

    Systemd user sessions started by user@.service are not able to
    easily inherit per-user environments (that depend on user specific
    values such as HOME) without creating a systemd --user wrapper. PAM
    environments are also unable to provide this. Due to the user@.service
    taking a UID instead of the username, it's not possible to build the
    environments in the service or via a drop-in configuration.
