# A word on usage: This script simply creates a list of all unowned files on
# the / filesystem.  After the user has manually validated the list the command
# can be run at a later date to generate a new list which is compared for any
# new entries.

# At this point if one is content with the additional files then one can mv
# the latest list to the known list thereby updating it.
